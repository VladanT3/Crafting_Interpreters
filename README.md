# Crafting Interpreters

This repo consists of two interpreters for a language called 'Lox', they were made following the book called 'Crafting Interpreters' which can be found at: https://craftinginterpreters.com

The first interpreter is written in Java and is a tree-walk interpreter which serves more as a way to learn some intricacies of how languages work and how they are made. Being written in Java and running on the JVM it's slow and unoptimized. That's where...

The second interpreter written in C comes in to play, it's a bytecode interpreter and is the 'final product', a fully functional and fast interpreter written for this little scripting language.
